# flutter_floating_action_button



#### This is a simple Flutter application that displays a single screen with a title and a message. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:
This is my learning repository. I use this program to learn Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. In this project, I demonstrate how to use Flutter widgets, state management, navigation, animations, and more. You can run this programs on Android or iOS devices.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


# Floating action button example program
This is a simple Flutter app that displays the text "Hello World" in the center of the screen and includes a floating action button that triggers a console log message when clicked.

# How to Use
To use this app, clone the repository and run it in a Flutter development environment. Make sure that you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
# Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to develop this program:

>Flutter 2.8.1
>Dart 2.15.1

# Description
This Flutter program is a simple mobile application example that displays a "Hello World" message. The application contains an `AppBar` component that shows the name of the application. Additionally, the main body of the application uses a Center widget to display the "Hello World" text on the screen. The text size, style, and color are customized using the TextStyle component.

The application also uses a `FloatingActionButton` component to capture the user's click event using the `onPressed()` method. This method prints the text "Clicked1" to the console.

The purpose of this program is to provide an example of how Flutter components can be used. Beginners can examine this program to start developing mobile applications in Flutter.
# Components Used
This app uses several Flutter components, including:

`MaterialApp`: A Flutter widget that provides a framework for implementing material design applications.

`Scaffold`: A material design widget that provides a basic structure for an app's user interface.

`AppBar`: A material design widget that provides a header for an app's user interface.

`Text`: A basic Flutter widget that displays a string of text.

`Center`: A widget that centers its child widget within its parent.

`FloatingActionButton`: A material design component that is used to represent a primary action in an application.

# FloatingActionButton Component
The FloatingActionButton (FAB) is a material design component that is used to represent a primary action in an application. It is typically placed at the bottom right corner of the screen and is represented by a circular icon. When the user clicks the FAB, it triggers an action.

In this program, the FAB component is used to capture the user's click event using the `onPressed()` method. The `onPressed()` method is a callback function that is called when the user clicks the FAB. In this program, when the user clicks the FAB, the `onPressed()` method prints the text "Clicked1" to the console.

The FAB component can be customized by changing its background color, icon, size, and shape. The background color of the FAB in this program is set to brown, and the icon color is set to red. The icon displayed on the FAB is the "add" icon from the Material Icons library.

In summary, the FAB component is a useful tool for representing primary actions in an application. Its customizable properties make it easy to adapt to different design styles and requirements.
